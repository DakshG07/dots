# Dukk's Neovim Config

These are my dotfiles. Just what I use daily, nothing fancy. Probably some bad practices and annoying defaults.

I currently use `Wezterm` as my editor of choice simply because it's fast, extensible, and customizable. In other words, everything I need. 
If you don't like anything here, feel free to change it. I often work with defaults simply because they work fine for me. You do you.
If you have a plugin which you feel is really cool and totally necessary, reach out via a PR!
This is meant to be used with a line size of `1.4` in Wezterm. This may not be the same for all editors. The value `1.4` simply means that all of my lines are scaled up by 40%. For me, this creates an interesting and satisfying effect.
There's also a font config for Neovide which sets the font to **Cascadia Code**.
Currently, the fonts I use are **MonoLisa**(paid) and **Cascadia Code**. Feel free to use your own fonts.
## Installation
Simply put this in your Neovim config folder and let the magic happen!

**Warning: This will delete any existing neovim configs.**
## Some advice
I'm not one to really be *giving* advice, but I really do believe that making your own configs can be a learning experience. Rather than split this config up, which *would* be the responsible thing to do, I've left it all in one file. Any beginners with Neovim should take the time to research all of these plugins. Personally, I got started by seeing which plugins others used, and adding those into my config until it became fully-fledged. Don't be afraid to ask for advice!
## Credit
Thanks to [winston](https://github.com/nekowinston) for his help on Discord. A lot of this config wouldn't be possible(or just would be a lot harder) without him.
